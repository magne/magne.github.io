# Progress Tracking

## What Works

- Project scaffolding with Astro and TypeScript
- Development environment setup (Biome, Lefthook)
- Memory Bank documentation structure
- Basic project organization
- Responsive navigation system with mobile support
- Accessible component structure with ARIA attributes
- Dark/light mode toggle integration

## What's Left to Build

1. **Core Site Structure**:
   - Main layout implementation
   - Footer components
   - Complete responsive design system

2. **Content Systems**:
   - Blog post collection and templates
   - Content organization structure
   - Blog post navigation

3. **Styling and Design**:
   - Design token system
   - Typography system
   - Component styling system

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Image optimization
   - Font loading strategy
   - CSS optimization
   - Core Web Vitals improvements

5. **Deployment**:
   - Finalize CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up hosting
   - Configure domain and SSL

## Current Status

The project has progressed from initial setup to having a functional navigation system. The blog-first approach has been implemented with proper mobile support and accessibility features. Focus is now shifting to content management and styling systems.

## Known Issues

1. Content organization needs refinement
2. No comprehensive styling system in place
3. Performance optimizations not yet implemented
4. Accessibility testing tools not yet configured

## Evolution of Decisions

- **Framework Choice**: Selected Astro for its static-first approach and partial hydration capabilities
- **Documentation**: Adopted the Memory Bank system for comprehensive documentation
- **Code Quality**: Implemented Biome for linting and formatting instead of ESLint/Prettier for better performance
- **Development Workflow**: Added Lefthook for consistent pre-commit checks
- **Navigation Approach**: Adopted blog-first strategy to focus on content delivery
- **Mobile First**: Implemented mobile-first design with progressive enhancement
- **Accessibility**: Integrated ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation from the start
