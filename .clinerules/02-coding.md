# Coding Rules

## Confidence Checks

- Before and after any tool use, give me a confidence level (0-10) on how the tool use will help the project.

## Code Quality

- Ensure the code is complete.

## Analysis and Planning

- Before writing code:

  1. Analyze all code files thoroughly
  2. Get full context
  3. Write .MD implementation plan in doc/plans
  4. Then implement code

- List all assumptions and uncertainties you need to clear up before completing a task.

## Thoughtful Development

- Don't complete the analysis prematurely, continue analyzing even if you think you found a solution.
- Rate confidence (1-10) before saving files, after saving, after rejections, and before task completion.

## Best Practices

- Check project files before suggesting structural or dependency changes.
- Use words like "elegant" and "simple" in prompts
