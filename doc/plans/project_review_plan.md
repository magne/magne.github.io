# Plan: Project Review

This document outlines the plan for conducting a detailed review of the `magne.github.io` project, as requested. The review will leverage the information gathered from the Memory Bank and direct analysis of the codebase.

## Objectives

1. Assess the project's organization and structure against Astro best practices and the project's stated goals.
2. Identify key architectural and coding patterns used throughout the codebase.
3. Pinpoint any obvious bugs, inconsistencies, or shortcomings.
4. Suggest areas for improvement regarding structure, code quality, performance, and adherence to goals.
5. Document findings in `doc/project_review.md`.

## Review Steps

1. **File Structure Analysis:**
    * Use `list_files` recursively on `src/` to get a comprehensive view of the file layout.
    * Compare the structure against the documented structure in `memory-bank/techContext.md` and standard Astro project layouts.

2. **Configuration Review:**
    * Read and analyze key configuration files:
        * `package.json` (dependencies, scripts)
        * `astro.config.ts` (Astro settings, integrations)
        * `tsconfig.json` (TypeScript setup)
        * `biome.json` (Linting/formatting rules)
        * `.editorconfig`, `.npmrc`, `lefthook.yml` (Supporting configs)

3. **Code Sampling & Pattern Identification:**
    * Read representative files from key directories:
        * `src/components/` (e.g., `Header.astro`, `PostCard.astro`, `ToggleTheme.astro`)
        * `src/layouts/` (e.g., `BaseLayout.astro`, `BlogPost.astro`)
        * `src/pages/` (e.g., `index.astro`, `posts/[...slug].astro`)
        * `src/content/` (Sample posts/structure)
        * `src/styles/` (`global.css`)
        * `src/utils/` (Sample utility functions)
    * Identify recurring patterns (component structure, props handling, state management if any, styling application, TypeScript usage).
    * Investigate the styling approach (Tailwind vs. CSS Modules vs. Global CSS).
    * Assess adherence to stated patterns (Islands, progressive enhancement, mobile-first, accessibility).

4. **Issue Identification (Based on Sampling & Context):**
    * Look for potential bugs (logic errors, rendering issues).
    * Identify inconsistencies in patterns or styling.
    * Note deviations from accessibility best practices (based on code structure).
    * Cross-reference findings with "Known Issues" and "What's Left to Build" in `memory-bank/progress.md`.

5. **Synthesize Findings & Document:**
    * Compile all observations.
    * Structure the findings logically in `doc/project_review.md` covering:
        * Overall Structure & Organization
        * Technology Choices & Configuration
        * Code Patterns & Implementation
        * Potential Issues & Shortcomings
        * Areas for Improvement
    * Provide specific examples where possible.

6. **Final Output:**
    * The completed `doc/project_review.md` file.

## Assumptions & Uncertainties

* **Assumption:** The Memory Bank provides an accurate, high-level overview of the project's intent and state.
* **Uncertainty:** The exact styling methodology needs clarification (Tailwind vs. CSS Modules vs. Global).
* **Uncertainty:** The review will be based on static analysis and code sampling; runtime behavior or complex interactions might not be fully captured without running the application.
